        <h1>How we started</h1>
		<br>
		<p>STATIONERY MARKET is a national retail chain focusing on stationery and books. Established in 1896 , STATIONERY MARKET has a footprint of 163 stores in South Africa and selected stores in Namibia , Botswana, Lesotho and Swaziland. We have embarked on a 5 year growth plan focussed on smaller store/shop sizes in convenient locations to better serve the broader South African customer.</p>
		<p>We continue with our strategy of being your favourite stationery store. Stationery, our category killer, dominates in our stores with a full spectrum of stationery across scholastic, home office and fashionable on trend items. In addition, there is a renewed focus in our Arts & Crafts ranges with a dramatically improved and increased offer to our customers.
</p>
		<p>Our secondary strategic focus remains Education. While we currently dominate the market with our study guides, the team is currently working on a comprehensive ECD (Education Child Development) range across the various life and learning stages of children with the involvement of Occupational Therapists and other subject matter experts in the industry.</p>
                <p>STATIONERY MARKET has been placed in business rescue since the 3rd of June 2021.</p>
