        <h1>Volunteering </h1>
		<br>
		<p>At Stationery Market, we believe the best way to make a difference is to make connections at grass-root level so it is important that all our projects are available for volunteers to connect with our beneficiary partners.

            ​
        
            Volunteering at Stationery Market is a fantastic way to give back, learn relevant skills to enhance your career move or work-readiness, or to simply meet like-minded friends.
            
             
            
            Our volunteer experience is a unique one, where remote operation opportunities are available, and through these opportunities you will be paired with a beneficiary partner to do onsite work too - providing a holistic opportunity to be able to learn the inner workings of the entire project. </p>
            
            ​
